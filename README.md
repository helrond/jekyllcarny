# jekyllcarny

A basic [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) implementation of [New England Carnegies](http://necarnegies.com/).

## Setup

### Clone repository

Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:jessamynwest/jekyllcarny.git`

This will download the repository to a `jekyllcarny` directory, and will automatically create a link to the Github repository with the short name `origin`.

### Install Jekyll

Detailed instructions for installing Jekyll are available via the [official documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).


## Making changes

### Edit files

Use your favorite text editor to make desired changes to content.

### Build site

Once you're done making changes, you'll build the site using Jekyll.

In a command prompt/terminal, navigate to the root directory of this repository and then run `jekyll build`. Jekyll will build the site in the `_site` directory.

If you want to preview the site locally, you can do so by running `jekyll serve`. You can then preview the site by pointing your browser to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

### Upload site

To update the site, simply FTP the `_site` directory to your web host.

### Commit and push changes

Finally, commit and push the Jekyll site to Github.

*   Add all changed files using `git add .`
*   Commit these changes using `git commit -m "your commit message"`
*   Then push this commit to Github with `git push origin master`
